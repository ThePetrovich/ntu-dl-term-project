Both qualitative and quantitative methods in machine learning can be adopted in the MDM process to accomplish different tasks in materials discovery, design, and optimization. State-of-the-art techniques in data mining-aided materials discovery and optimization are demonstrated by reviewing the controllable synthesis of dendritic Co3O4 superstructures, materials design of layered double hydroxide, battery materials discovery, and thermoelectric materials design. The results of the case studies indicate that MDM is a powerful approach for use in materials discovery and innovation, and will play an important role in the development of the Materials Genome Initiative and Materials Informatics."

Traditional experiments and computational modelling often consume tremendous time and resources and are limited by their experimental conditions and theoretical foundations. Thus, it is imperative to develop a new method of accelerating the discovery and design process for novel materials. Recently, materials discovery and design using machine learning have been receiving increasing attention and have achieved great improvements in both time efficiency and prediction accuracy. In this review, we first outline the typical mode of and basic procedures for applying machine learning in materials science, and we classify and compare the main algorithms. Then, the current research status is reviewed with regard to applications of machine learning in material property prediction, in new materials discovery and for other purposes. Finally, we discuss problems related to machine learning in materials science, propose possible solutions, and forecast potential directions of future research. By directly combining computational studies with experiments, we hope to provide insight into the parameters that affect the properties of materials, thereby enabling more efficient and target-oriented research on materials discovery and design."

abstract = {Abstract The research of metamaterials has achieved enormous success in the manipulation of light in a prescribed manner using delicately designed subwavelength structures, so-called meta-atoms. Even though modern numerical methods allow for the accurate calculation of the optical response of complex structures, the inverse design of metamaterials, which aims to retrieve the optimal structure according to given requirements, is still a challenging task owing to the nonintuitive and nonunique relationship between physical structures and optical responses. To better unveil this implicit relationship and thus facilitate metamaterial designs, it is proposed to represent metamaterials and model the inverse design problem in a probabilistically generative manner, enabling to elegantly investigate the complex structure–performance relationship in an interpretable way, and solve the one-to-many mapping issue that is intractable in a deterministic model. Moreover, to alleviate the burden of numerical calculations when collecting data, a semisupervised learning strategy is developed that allows the model to utilize unlabeled data in addition to labeled data in an end-to-end training. On a data-driven basis, the proposed deep generative model can serve as a comprehensive and efficient tool that accelerates the design, characterization, and even new discovery in the research domain of metamaterials, and photonics in general.},

abstract = "Phononic crystal is a type of artificial heterogeneous material constituted by a periodic repetition of cells. This characteristic provides a possible solution to the accurate manipulation of acoustic and elastic waves. For this reason, phononic crystal is of application potentials in vibration and noise reduction, filtering, acoustic lens, acoustic imaging, and acoustic stealth, etc. It is thus of significance in the fields of information, communication, and medical applications. To design phononic crystal with anticipated manipulation characteristic has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, how to accurately manipulate acoustic and mechanical wave is still a major challenge for existing designing approaches. Assisted by image-based finite element analysis and deep learning, a data-driven approach is proposed in this study for designing phononic crystals. An auto-encoder is trained to extract the topological features from sample images. Finite element analysis is employed to study the band gaps of samples. A multi-layer perceptron is trained to establish the inherent relation between band gaps and topological features. The trained models are ultimately employed to design phononic crystals with anticipated band gaps. Not limited to this material, the proposed method could be further extended to design various structured mechanical materials with specific functionalities."
